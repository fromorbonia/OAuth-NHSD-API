# Example: Web Client & Server App Authenticating with NHS Digital OAuth

Some OAuth providers enable you to reuse the authentication of an OIDC provider. If you trust that OIDC provider, have only simply requirements, then it can save your application from managing it's own user database. The NHS Digital API Platform has a similar option, and this example walks through how to integrate with it using the standard Microsoft ASP.NET Core libraries.
